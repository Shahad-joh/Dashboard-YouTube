# Dashboard for YouTube data

A dashboard for YouTube data to view the highest views on YouTube is designed in a way that presents the data in a clear and concise manner. The dashboard would be designed to display key performance indicators (KPIs) related to the highest views, such as the top videos by views or the top channels by views.

The dashboard includes the following components:

1. A line chart displays the year of publication vs views over time.

2. A bar chart that displays the most viewed videos and the number of views. 

3. A bubble chart that shows the top categories for videos by views. 

4. A map or geographic chart that displays the distribution of views by region. This chart would help to identify any regional or country-specific trends in views.


The dashboard designed to be interactive and user-friendly, allowing users to drill down into the data and explore different views and channels. Additionally, the dashboard would be designed to be responsive and accessible on different devices, including desktop computers, tablets, and mobile phones. Overall, a well-designed dashboard for YouTube data would provide valuable insights into the highest views and help users to make informed decisions about their YouTube strategy.
